A landing page per the specification - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

## Motivation
This is the second project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). This project has allowed me to experement with flexbox and using padding to center a page responsively.
